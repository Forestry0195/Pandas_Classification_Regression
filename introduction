Regression finds correlations between dependent and independent variables. 
Therefore, regression algorithms help predict continuous variables such as house prices, market trends, weather patterns, oil and gas prices (a critical task these days!), etc
The Regression algorithm’s task is finding the mapping function so we can map the input variable of “x” to the continuous output variable of “y.”

Classification is an algorithm that finds functions that help divide the dataset into classes based on various parameters. 
When using a Classification algorithm, a computer program gets taught on the training dataset and categorizes the data into various categories depending on what it learned.
